NoSQL Challenge Data
=======================

Data Challenge
-------------------

* Simulated Network Prefix Registration Data


Inspirations
-------------
* NoSQL West
* Genetic Analysis Workshop, where teams of researchers work on the same
  (simulated) data, to show off techniques and tools.  I simulated the data
  for GAW 15.  cf:  http://www.gaworkshop.org/gaw15.htm

Benefits for NoSQL Kit Authors
---------------------------
* Show off framework capabilities
* have a "real" dataset to show off on
* Prestige
